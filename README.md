# OAD Data Retrieval 
This is my simple code to enable users online to search the OAD Projects Database. 
HTML, PHP and MySQL were used to create a front-end website with simple search parameters that link to a SQL database with the relevant project information.

The main file is the Retrieve.php which currently runs on my localhost but I will soon open up publicly.

It is still heavily under development and I'm currently working on code more suited to the OAD needs:
    
    - Internal repository of all project related information, from application stage to details of grant, project updates,           challenges, and final report
    - Internal database of other OAD information: internal reports, admin documents, reference materials, other historical           records
    - Potential project leaders submit their proposals online
    - The public can query the database via keywords (PI, project, region, taskforce, year etc)
This should streamline project management once sufficiently developed.
