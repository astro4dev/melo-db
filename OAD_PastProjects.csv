"(Re-)integration of DPRK astronomers in the international research community",1,2013,"DPRK China       ","The most pressing need for the development of professional astronomy in the DPRK is professional training. In this context, we propose to initiate an exchange and training programme between Pyongyang Astronomical Observatory (PAO) and counterparts in China and eventually Europe, monitored by the East Asian node of the Office of Astronomy for Development. PAO representatives have already reached agreement in principle to send junior researchers (postdocs or junior faculty members) to the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) and the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA) at Peking University, both in Beijing. We request funding to enable two junior researchers, selected by PAO, to spend one year in China, where they will be immersed in scientific research (and training) at an internationally competitive level. Upon their return to the DPRK, they will act as mentors to their colleagues there. In addition, during the year-long exchange visit, we anticipate that the junior researchers from the DPRK will be actively involved in research projects at the host institutes, which will eventually lead to publications in the international peer- reviewed literature. We also seek travel funding for visits of DPRK students and researchers to institutes outside Asia, once suitable host organisations have been identified."
"Astronomy lectures for university students and teachers in Accra, Ghana",1,2013,"Ghana        ","A workshop for astronomy development will be offered at the Planetarium in Accra to University students and teachers from all over Ghana and neighbouring countries – Burkina Faso, Senegal, Nigeria.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together University students and international astronomy educators to promote and encourage the higher level study of Astronomy and make a contribution  to taking it forward as part of the country’s development in science and technology.  Possible routes into higher studies and career paths will be discussed. This workshop will be an importnant step towards reducing the “knowledge gap” between students and researchers in this region and those in other parts of the world where highly-developed astronomy research facilities exist. This school will happen right after the week-long workshop for school teachers (twinned proposal that was submitted to TF2).  Some participants for the university workshop (week 2) can attend the workshop for school teachers (week 1)."
"Guatemalan School of Astrophysics",1,2013,"Guatemala        ","We want to launch the GUAtemalan School of Astrophysics (GUASA), to be held in a rural area of Guatemala every two years. The school aims to bring together local Central American/Caribbean undergraduate students of physics/mathematics/engeneering, with experts from prestigious astronomical institutions from around the world. During each of its editions, we expect to cover a wide range of modern topics of astrophysics in order to motivate the students to pursue major degrees in astronomy elsewhere. We hope that this school will contribute to create a critical mass of professional astronomers/astrophysicists in the region along with the conditions needed for research, thus leading to the creation of strong astrophysics departments in the Universities of the region. In the future, after a few editions of GUASA, we hope to be able to include lecturers from the local academic community. As a complementary activity of every edition of GUASA, we also want to organize outreach activities for the general public, such as public lectures followed by observations using small telescopes. These activities we hope, will encourage children and teenagers to get closer to science and to continue their studies aiming for superior education."
"MENA Regional Summer School: ""Astronomy with Small Telescopes"" ",1,2013,"Lebanon        ","Small telescopes are optimal for the developing world. They can be used for public outreach, education, and with the proper instrumentation, astronomical research. The MENA region holds many observatories and projects equipped with small telescopes. Lebanon's first small facility will be online late 2012.
We, thus, plan to have a regional summer school on astronomy with small telescopes in late August 2013 in Lebanon. The school is intended for advanced physics students, and graduate students in physics and astronomy, It aims to show how small telescopes can be used in astronomical research. It will provide basic training on the use of small telescopes and present the science that is doable with such instruments. The capacity of the school will be 40 students. Instructors will be astronomers from Lebanon, the region, and from Europe and North America.
The program of the school will assume the existence of a basic level in physics appropriate to advanced physics undergraduates, and minimal formal knowledge of astronomy. It will cover topics related to galaxies, stars, solar system objects, exoplanets, from the viewpoint of small telescopes. The school’s lectures will be at a level accessible to advanced undergraduate students in physics."
"National Workshop on Astronomy & Astrophysics (NWAA2013), Kathmandu, Nepal",1,2013,"Nepal        ","The Central Department of Physics, Tribhuvan University has been helping to bring the world of Astronomy & Astrophysics to interested Nepalese students since 2008 by offering Astrophysics as an elective course in the Master's level. No separate department or institute of A&A is established till date in Nepal. In spite of this, more than 250 M.Sc. (Physics) students have chosen ‘Astrophysics’ as an elective paper. These students are studying in the eight different colleges all around the country. All these colleges are affiliated with Tribhuvan University. Till date 74 masters’ thesis have been completed in Astrophysics. A few of masters’ theses are published in the Journals MNRAS, A&A, and Ap&SS (detail below). At present, three graduates are involved in Ph.D. and 16 are doing research work for their master’s thesis in the department. The research areas are galaxy evolution, dust structures around PNe, White Dwarfs and Pulsars, chirality of large scale structure, modeling galaxy rotation curve and observational work (16 inch Schmidt Telescope). Additional Information regarding publications, past and present on-going Ph.D. research and M.Sc. dissertation work are available in http://astronepal.webs.com. We also have a few experiences of collaborative work and organizing/hosting conferences in the various aspects of A&A in the past.
Keeping aspiration of young students in mind, we have decided to organize a workshop in order to provide an extensive learning environment. We intend to provide an exposure to the virtual observatories, database, software and basic programming language which is commonly used in astrophysical research. Our aim is to make students familiar with the process of problem identification as well as problem solving procedure. The workshop is mainly for photometry and spectrometry. For this, we use the data available in the ADS/SIMBAD/NED/SkyView. We will focus on infrared and X-ray astronomy and use IRAS images and XMM Newton spectra using software AstroLinux, ALADIN and MATLAB (below for details).
This workshop will be organized by the Central Department of Physics, Tribhuvan University in its premises at Kirtipur, Kathmandu during 14-18 April 2013 and supported by Ministry of S&T National Academy of S&T, Nepal Physical Society and Astrophysics and Cosmology Research Group. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experienced as well as young students who are interested in working actively on various important aspects of Astronomy & Astrophysics using the data available in the internet."
"Starlight in the university lab 2013",1,2013,"Nigeria Zambie       ","The project aims at fully developing and implementing a research tutorial, Astrolab, in universities in need of astronomy infrastructure and curriculum, allowing undergraduate students in sciences to perform real-time observations on a remote telescope, and transforming those observations into a scientific result.
The goal of this project is twofold :
a) to introduce students to the scientific research method in general by working scientifically through project development and preparation, data acquisition and treatment, analysis and conclusions.
b) to enhance interest in science studies by making them more attractive and getting the students involved in the “learning”.
The level is that of science students at an introductory astronomy course (1st or 2nd BSc), but can be adapted downwards as well as upwards.
Astrolab is implemented at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel since 4 years.
This project is a pilot one: it will first be developed in 2 partner universities, and after a test period of 3 years it could be implemented in various other universities."
"Strengthening Astronomy Resercah at University in Rwanda (Phase 1)",1,2013,"Rwanda        ","During the year 2009, IAU donated 5 computers to help students and Lecturers to learn and use astronomy softwares. The computers run completely on linux. With these computers, KIE students have now a possibility to choose astronomy/space science for their undergraduate final year research projects.
In order to make these computers more useful, a permanent astronomy research team is needed. In fact, as we have already entered in the era where Astronomy research can be done locally even in the developing countries using online data mining (some of these data are semi or completely reduced ). In order to make use of these data, there is a need to have a research team trained on various softwares for data reduction to ensure quality in data handling and interpretation.
In addition, following the growing initiatives to build telescopes in East Africa e.g. the Entoto Optical observatory project (in Ethiopia) and the extension of the SKA radio dishes up to Kenya, research teams need to be introduced at universities to make use (for long term) of the data output of these infrastructures. In these regards, there will be opportunity to get data for our own planned objects.
In this project (phase I), we intend to build an astrophysics research team in Rwanda. The phase II will consist at extending it to the whole region an build a pana-East-African multi-wavelength research team which will be able to reduce multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic data (Radio, Optical, X-ray, gamma-rays).
In this phase ONE, we intend a two-week workshop in which we will invite visiting astronomers to train the members of the research team (Lecturers doing research in Astrophysics and related sciences in Rwanda) on the proper use of softwares of handling the data. Equal emphasis in the first phase will be also put in the consolidation of a theoretical background on the understanding and analysing the spectroscopic and photometric properties of stars and galaxies. These lectures will be allocated 2-3 hours every morning, the first week being on “stars and galaxies” and the second week being on extragalactic objects. The rest of the hours of the days will be allocated to introduce the available data and missions, study softwares e.g. IRAF, HEASOFT and other plotting data softwares like TOPCAT etc. Participation of astronomers of the region will be encouraged."
"An astronomical kit for the visually impaired",2,2013,"Developing Countries In Southamerica Developing Countries In Africa Developing Countries In Asia      ","The goal is to develop a kit with different astronomical activities to help communicators and teachers in reaching children with visual impairments. The kit will consist of: (a) ""The sky in your hands"", a planetarium program with original soundtrack in various languages, and a half-sphere with constellations engraved in it, (b) a booklet of activities to be carried out with the planetarium half-sphere, (c) a tactile 3D Moon specially designed for the visually impaired, along with a booklet of Moon activities, (d) one set of the FETTU braille sheets with an activity guide, and (e) a book on tactile astronomy. The kit will be sent to developing countries through the Universe Awerness (UNAWE), Astronomers without Borders (AWB) and Global Hands-On Universe (GHOU) networks of national points of contact in those regions or countries. Depending on the amount of funding available, we are planning to send initially 10 kits to Asia, 10 to Africa and 8 to Southamerica. Another 2 will be carried around by the Galileo Mobile project to difficult to reach regions of the world."
"Astronomical measurements in Ancient Greece",2,2013,"Greece        ","Although it is not widely known to students and the public, the ancient Greek philosophers had made a number of accurate astronomical measurements and created successful models in an effort to describe the wonders of the Cosmos. With the power of the human mind they carried out reasonable estimates of the sizes of the earth, the moon and the sun and the distances of the sun and moon from the earth.  This project’s aim is two-fold. Firstly it aims at bringing this knowledge to the secondary education students, who, by carrying out these measurements, will appreciate how an innovative mind can explore the universe from our little planet. The students will carry on exploring the universe beyond the earth, moon and sun and by analysing their observations will evolve their knowledge on the universe and change any alternative ideas held to the scientific accepted ones. Secondly, it is this project’s aim to support these students in reaching out the community and spreading this knowledge to the public so that everyone can realize that the cosmos is not far out of reach but is within everybody’s grasp to explore it even from their own backyard, as the Ancient Greek astronomers did.  The first goal will be accomplished by incorporating the project in the context of the Spring Term course of the Greek curriculum called “Project” of the 16-year-old secondary students. Within this course the students will learn the fundamental elements of earth and sky motion, will restore any misconceptions inherited by their surroundings, will carry out the aforementioned measurements and will make observations of the sun at normal class hours and sky observations at evening sessions. The second aim will be accomplished by supporting these students along with invited university experts to present their techniques and findings at a series of public lectures and workshops to the students of the other schools of the district and the local community during the local cultural festivities in the summer of 2013.  Astronomy project classes will continue in the Fall Term 2013 when the students will expand their knowledge beyond the local neighbourhood by carrying out observations and astrophotography of the wonders of the Cosmos around us. All the project’s actions will be disseminated to the world via a special area in the school’s web site thus producing a legacy of astronomical observations for the next generations.

"Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP) Nepal",2,2013,"Nepal        ","In Nepal, astronomy is included in the school syllabus and a very few related contents are included in the higher level education. Teachers in the schools are the general science graduates, usually not experts in astronomy. It indicates the need of a teacher training event for the educators. Teachers are  also the easy way of reaching hundreds of young kids and in a way to the society.  We plan to invest our effort in teachers and in astronomy educators. GTTP has been organized in Nepal since 2010. Almost 60 teachers have got the opportunity in past. In 2013, the training event will be of two days including lectures, workshops and a night sky observation program. Speakers from the universities or from Nepal Astronomical Society (NASO) will be invited. Participants are invited from different schools from different regions of the country. Some travel supports will be available for needy participants. Science communicators are also welcomed in the event. We include the basic concepts of astronomy, some hands on activities, and a workshop on astronomy software in the event. An observation program will be organized at the end of the event day using 8” skywatcher telescope owned by Nepal Astronomical Society (NASO). At the end of the event, all the participants are expected to have clear concepts on basic astronomy topics and knowledge of hands on activities which can be carried out in classrooms. We also expect the participants to start using basic astronomy software in their class rooms and their knowledge to popularize astronomy/science in their community. "
"Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy",2,2013,"Kenya        ","Project Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy aims at promoting astronomy among primary school teachers and students in Mathare slum of Nairobi (Kenya) through improving their knowledge and skills, providing educational aids and creating the network of Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy – a team of trained teachers capable of training their colleagues thus multiplying the outputs of the project.
Mathare slum is a non-formal settlement characterised by high level of poverty, lack of proper infrastructure and poor sanitary conditions. Most of 80 primary schools located in the slum offer low quality education, especially in the field of science and astronomy. Since 2009 Partners Poland Foundation has been working to improve the quality of education by investing in teachers’ skills and educational infrastructure. Trainings on practical science and astronomy organised in previous years, opening of two computer centres and science lab in Mathare will make it possible to carry out the project Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy.
The project will consist of 5 main activities:
i. Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy Training of Trainers
At least 12 teachers already cooperating with Partners Poland Foundation will undergo intense and advanced training on astronomy and presentation skills to be able to transfer their knowledge and skills to other teachers from Mathare.
ii. Introduction of Astronomy to Mathare Schools
Trained Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy will train at least 54 primary school
teachers in Mathare on basics of practical astronomy and usage of galileoscopes.
iii. Provision of astronomy educational aids
At least 20 schools from Mathare will be provided with total of 35 galileoscopes and toolkit comprising of 10 lessons on practical astronomy that can be delivered in the classroom.

iv. Astronomy workshops in the classroom
Both Mathare Ambassadors of Astronomy and their trainees will conduct practical
astronomy lessons for at least 1500 primary school students in Mathare.
v. Mathare Astronomy Exhibition
A display of astronomy artefacts created during teachers’ trainings and workshops for students (e.g. models of solar system, umbrella planetariums etc.) will be organised. The purpose of the exhibition is to Promote Interest for Astronomy for Astronomy among teachers, students and other members of Mathare community."
"Network for Astronomy School Education (NASE) Africa",2,2013,NULL,"According to the IAU Strategic Plan, the mission of the IAU in world astronomy development consists of stimulating the application of astronomy in all its forms as a benefit to society and humankind.
The IAU has several projects which involve points Science Public Outreach, Tertiary education and Research. But NASE is a specific project for Secondary and Primary schools teachers. It is crucial to act before the university and research period in the curricula of children and teenagers. If the pupils have a positive contact with astronomy, they may decide to be astronomers, but it is very difficult to choose to study something which is not known to them.
Astronomy should be more present in the school. It is necessary to educate teachers in astronomy topics. In general, there is astronomy in school curricula, but if teachers do not have available possibilities of the observatory, they probably will limit their astronomy lessons only to the contents of books in a very theoretical way. All schools in all the countries in the world have an “astronomy lab”: this is the court of the school. The teachers with not enough instruction can use it.
The courses and materials will be produced in the language of the country where we are working with teachers: English.
NASE will organise two or three courses for secondary or primary school teachers in Centre or South America in cooperation with a Local Organising Committee (NASE GROUP) will have to organise the following editions every year. After the course, the NASE GROUP (group of 6-8 teachers) should be put together, in coordination with the NASE Programme can then continue organising other activities in the country (courses, seminars, festivals, performances, workshops and the basic NASE course too) every year in each country.
NASE do not have contacts in Africa, we ask for OAD support to decide the countries that will be visited. In 2013 we plan to participate in several conferences and meeting in different countries in order to explain NASE programs"
"Astronomía Periférica (Peripheral Astronomy)",3,2013,"Colombia        ","Astronomía Periférica is a project aimed at bringing the poetic force of astronomy into the periphery of Latin-American cities. Our tools are art, design and science. The project is embodied in three interdependent activities with one common concept: observation. Our target public are those who do not have immediate access to the established centers of astronomical knowledge (museums, universities, planetariums.)
The hierarchical transmission of knowledge is a hurdle in stimulating people into taking responsibility for exploring, understanding and challenging the world we live in. These hierarchies are promoted by the academic and scientific establishment. Through a more open-ended process and without explicit knowledge hierarchies, artistic experimentation offers a way to overcome this problem. Another caveat with traditional outreach activities is the limited scope of the target population. It leaves out the people without time, physical and cultural resources to visit the knowledge centers (school, museum, planetarium). The artistic experience is a medium to lower that barrier and engage people, making them feel part of a world that often sends the opposite message by excluding them from knowledge circuits.
The core team behind Astronomía Periférica is composed by two artists (Luis Bustamante and Alejandro Tamayo) and one astrophysicist (Jaime Forero-Romero). Each member will take the lead of a different activity, while keeping a collaborative edge through the project. The working titles of the three activities in Astronomia Periferica are: ‘Beyond Satelistica’, ‘Macrocosmos and Domestic Microcosmos’ and ‘Notebook Universe’
‘Satelistica’ (led by Luis) deals with sonorizations and visualizations of satellite observations; ‘Macrocosmos and Domestic Microcosmos’ (led by Alejandro) uses household items to create sculptures that remind us that we live in a rotating planet travelling a great speeds through the Universe; ‘Notebook Universe’ (led by Jaime) is a long year project that focuses on amateur drawing of naked eye and small telescope observations.
We will implement the project in Bogotá, Colombia, using a setup that could be useful in other similar Latin-American cities such as Medellín, Quito, Lima or Caracas. Astronomia Periferica will take place during the year 2013. The project will be hosted by Universidad de los Andes. Additional support and advice will be provided by external team members: Lucia Ayala (art historian), Javier Moreno (mathematician and writer), Manuel Santana (artist), Pilar Becerra (astronomy outreach expert); and institutions: Museo de la Ciencia y el Juego (Museum for Science and Play) and the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional."
"Astronomy for Extremely ill or Traumatically Injured Children and Their Families",3,2013,"United States        ","The purpose of this grant is to provide funding to provide telescope observations and astronomy demonstrations for children, their siblings, and adult family members staying at the Ronald McDonald Houses of Chicagoland  (RMH-Chicago) in conjunction the children’s surgery and medical treatments at nearby hospitals.  The project will provide an educational out-of-this world diversion from the stress of being sick or of having a sick family member hospitalized. The grant will also test the effectiveness of this project prior to the submisison of a large-scale grant for multiple RMHs.  The RMHs are a ""home away from home"" for families of critically ill or traumatically injured children undergoing medical treatment in nearby hospitals. The RMHs provide a comfortable, supportive alternative atmosphere to expensive hotels where family members can sleep, eat, relax and find support from other families in similar situations. Families are kept united at a time when mutual support is often as critical as the medical treatment itself. The ill children and their families may stay for a few days but some will stay for months because of chemotherapy, dialysis, or rehabilitative therapy.  There are now 250 RMHs in the US and 60 in other countries. The telescope observations and hands-on astronomy demonstrations will provide a unique family learning experience. Innovative edible demonstrations using chocolate, marshmallows, and popcorn will be used to present astronomy and space science concepts to enhance learning and achieve a greater educational impact.  The program includes activities specially designed for ages ranging from elementary school to high school along with the adult family members.  Because the families come from across the US, they will be given information about local science museums, and local astronomy clubs (with free or low-cost memberships).  Astronomical demonstrations will be conducted using telescope observations of the Sun, Moon, planets, stars, and nebulae in conjunction with astronomical demonstrations and family activities. An imager will be used so the children can take their own astronomical images.  The activities include both daytime and nighttime activities and are designed for all weather and all ages.  Galieloscope  and  IYA2009, ASP project Astro and ASP Family Astro activities will be used.  The RMH-Chicago education staff will be trained to use: easy to operate go-to telescope to take advantage of clear weather and interesting celestial events; Stellarium to show the sky; Astronomy or Sky and Telescopes Magazine sites to find out about astronomical events; and demonstration materials.

"Chinese Ancient Poetry Astrophotography",3,2013,"China        ","Our ancestors are closer to the night sky than we are. Celestial objects such as the Sun, the Moon, the milky way, star constellations and comets are mentioned in many Chinese ancient poems and stories. The sky nearly never changes. We see the same sky as Li Bai, a Chinese famous poet, did 1200 years ago. Chinese people were taught ancient poems when they were very young, but were never taught the astronomy in the poems. In fact, parents and teachers do not know about them.   The project will take pictures of the night sky according to the Chinese famous ancient poems. However, the people who know the poems do not know astronomy and photography, and the people who know astronomy do not know the poems and photography, and so on.  Therefore, the project will absorb people with different background to work together: Chinese literature teachers: select astronomical poetry; Astronomers: explain the selected poems; Photographers:  take pictures according to the selected poetry. The artist and designers: give good ideas of getting beautiful pictures. The slogan of the project: Appreciate Chinese Poetry night sky!   By the Autumn of 2014, 40 pictures with Chinese poetry photography  will be: Showing on the Beijing Planetarium website which can be downloaded all over the world. These pictures will show the Chinese Culture Vision Sky.   2)  Exhibited in Beijing Planetarium exhibition hall.  3) Used as examples to unites and inspire more people to provide different culture astronomic poems and astrophotography for next exhibition and website content all over the world."
"Coordinating Astronomy for Public Outreach in Viet Nam: Bringing Astronomy to Remote Areas",3,2013,"Vietnam        ","Viet Nam is a developing country with the population of about 90 million people and it is on the heimat of economic development. However, astronomy is still not being much appreciated in Viet Nam. Therefor, this project has two fold objectives. First of all, we aim at building up a coherent, unique online website to coordinate activities of amateur astronomy clubs in Viet Nam and to spread out astronomical news, knowledge in a more organised way. Secondly, we aim at organising various observing nights and hands-on activities in remote provinces to increase awareness of people on astronomy.
For the moment, there are several amateur astronomy clubs in Vietnam (see figure 1) but they are loosely connected. Currently, the internet domain www.vietastro.org is the most updated website in Viet Nam about astronomy, maintained by Ho Chi Minh City Amateur Astronomy Club (HAAC). It is providing astronomical knowledge and news in Vietnamese as well as becoming the official information portal of amateur astronomy activities held by local clubs and organisations in Viet Nam. With the help of OAD-IAU, we are targeting at becoming the main hub to coordinate amateur astronomy activities as well as to circulate information on the astronomical events, and developments of the country and of the whole world. Besides that, we also want to have this website to be translated into English to serve as a portal of Vietnamese amateur astronomers to the outer world. To achieve this goal, we will maintain two groups of amateur astronomers. One translation group to translate reports of amateur astronomy activities in Viet Nam into English and translate news, articles, and writings about astronomy in English into Vietnamese. The other one performs technical works to keep the website up to date and visually attractive to the public.
Viet Nam has more than 330 square kilometres of land and is divided into 63 provinces and municipalities. However, most of scientific and cultural activities occur in the two largest cities: Ho Chi Minh City, and Ha Noi, the capital. Astronomy is not an exception. There are active clubs only in Ho Chi Minh City and Ha Noi, currently. We plan to publicise astronomy further to other provinces in 2013 if this proposal is accepted by delivering several hands-on activities such as: public observations, astrophotography, basic lectures."
"Dark Skies Outreach to Sub-Saharan Africa",3,2013,NULL,"We propose to optimize and implement the successful Dark Sky Rangers/GLOBE at Night citizen scientist program in 12-15 sub-Saharan African countries.
The GLOBE at Night program, hosted by the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), is an international citizen-science campaign to raise public awareness of the impact of light pollution. The worldwide campaign invites citizen- scientists to record the brightness of the night sky by visually matching the appearance of a constellation like Orion with star maps of progressively fainter stars or using meters to obtain more precise measurements. Measurements are submitted to a central website by paper, computer, or smart phone. From these data an interactive map of all worldwide observations is created. Every year, NOAO is adding more opportunities for participation by providing campaigns at different times of year and creating Web applications in different languages for smart phones. Over the past 7 years of 10-day campaigns, people in 115 countries have contributed over 83,000 measurements, making GLOBE at Night the most successful, light pollution citizen-science campaign to date. (See www.globeatnight.org for more information.) Sub-Saharan African countries have been dramatically under-represented in Globe at Night  campaigns.The proposed effort will help address the lack of public dark sky awareness in these regions and, more importantly, tap into the inherent wonder of the night sky shared by all cultures to increase science awareness within these populations. To provide foundational activities for GLOBE at Night, NOAO developed the Dark Skies Rangers program during the International Year of Astronomy (2009). Dark Skies Rangers is a set of environmental/astronomy-based lesson plans for grades 3 through 12 that help students learn the importance of maintaining dark skies. The EPO group’s expertise in developing teaching kits and instructional materials for schools, museums, and after- school programs helped create the suite of well-tested and evaluated hands-on, minds-on activities. The activities have children building star-brightness “readers,” creating glow- in-the-dark tracings to visualize constellations, and role-playing confused sea turtles. They also create a model city with shielded lights to stop upward light, examine different kinds of bulbs for energy efficiency, and perform an outdoor lighting audit of their school or neighborhood. (See www.globeatnight.org/dsr/ for more information.) The proposed program includes an innovative series of Skype sessions for educators and students, a website for exchanges of ideas and student posters, a list-serve, well-vetted kits, an novel twinning program for additional Sky Quality Meters, and participation in the GLOBE at Night campaign."
"Limpopo Astronomy Public Outreach (LAPO)",3,2013,"South Africa        ","Limpopo Astronomy Public Outreach will visit 13 venues in various towns in Limpopo Province over the course of a five month period (see point 9 for venues).

“Fossils, Light & Time”, a visual display of cosmic and fossil history going back 2.1 billion years with a South African flavour.  Consisting of 26 laminated A4 pages, portraying the impact of the Vredefort meteorite and ending present day with fossil history from the floods in Laingsburg.  A selection of posters sourced from SAAO and SAASTA depicting the following:  Our solar system, the electromagnetic spectrum, your place in the universe.  These will be on display and also handed out.  Various other astronomy related posters and material will also be on display.  Please note that these posters have not been budgeted into this proposal as they are usually donated by the two organizations. Practical:  Viewing the Sun and observing sunspots with a telescope and sun-filter.  Will include handout material with facts and figures on the Sun on one side of A4 page.  The reverse side will have information on the Moon. Solar system, facts and figures will include handout material as well as practical display of the size and distance to the planets.  Information on viewable planets at the time will be included on the reverse side of the page. Stargazing evenings will include South African star-lore and the identification of some of the constellations that are visible as well as views through the telescope of some of the planets, stars and deepsky objects.  Explanations of how stars and planets “move”, the difference between them etc., will be discussed. A video camera attached to the telescope instead of the eyepiece will project onto a screen, real time images of what the telescope is pointing at.  This is the perfect tool for astronomy outreach as large groups can be targeted.  As an example, real time views of the Moon, Saturn, a double star or star-forming region in the sky is projected, with an explanation of what we are looking such as:  Explanation of how and when the Moon was formed, why we see different phases, composition of Saturn’s rings and the structure, show its moons including the largest one Titan, etc. etc.  Open & Globular clusters:  An explanation of these types of stellar groupings.  Nebulae:  An explanation of the various nebulae and much more.Short clips consisting of some current material such as the launching and landing of NASA’s Curiosity on Mars, as well as material on the Space Shuttle and ISS and Apollo footage."
"Institute Twinning between the University of Antioquia (Colombia) and the Leiden Observatory",1,2014,"Colombia Netherlands Chile Venezuela Ecuador Peru Bolivia Other Andean Countries ","In the context of the IAU Strategic Plan, and in parallel to the creation of an Andean Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (Andean ROAD), the Astronomy undergraduate program at the University of Antioquia (UofA) and the Leiden Observatory (LO) have successfully become twin institutions in 2013. This partnership has the specific goals of boosting the development and improving the quality of astronomy teaching and research at the UofA and other institutions in Andean region, by offering to the community an archive of open online courses at the advanced undergrad level, among other activities. In August 2013 two lecturers from Leiden visited the UdeA and taught advanced courses in astrophysics to an audience of at least 80 undergrads from several institutions, and to a broader audience through the live streaming and recording of the lectures, now available online. The courses were graded and successful students were given academic credits upon completion. Additionally, a joint LO-UdeA advisory committee has evaluated the structure and content of the courses offered at the UofA and the National Astronomical Observatory (OAN) in Bogotá, and provided advice on new courses and possible research fields on which the Andean students can carry on their thesis work. The resulting report is also available online. In connection with Task Force 3 activities, two public lectures with ~300 attendees were offered to the people of Medellín, and posted online to reach a broader audience in the region. With this proposal we are requesting funding for a continuation of this program, with the same structure and enhanced objectives, during 2014. Although we keep the twinning spirit of this proposal, we aim at reaching other institutions in Colombia and the Andean Region, through direct participation of their students, as well as replication of the courses and online posting of the lectures."
"Joint Exchange Development Initiative for Africa",1,2014,"Mauritius Namibia       ","Astronomy has grown significantly in recent years and the amount of scientific data available online has exploded. Astronomers have been doing data mining for centuries, characterizing the known, assigning the new and discovering unknowns. These skills are more critical than ever especially with new facilities coming online. We are now entering a data intensive research era. Virtual observatories (VO) have been set up across the world and data are accessible publicly. Nowadays, one does not need to build an instrument to do astronomy, but rather to start with an idea, explore the internet world to gather as much information as possible and then solve or contribute to a problem. On the African continent, the access of data via the internet is still problematic but the future seems more promising, with new world class facilities coming up such as the SALT, HESS and SKA. However, there is a scarcity of trained astronomers to pass on the research philosophy and methodologies to others. The Joint Exchange Development Initiative (JEDI) is a concept to enhance development and education via direct transfer of skills and expertise in any specific field. It is an initiative to provide development via joint exchange among stakeholders. This is achieved by bringing stakeholders: students, postdocs and staffs together in an informal but intense research environment to tackle unsolved problems for e.g. in Astronomy. The JEDI has a very scalable concept. JEDI have been carried out among undergraduate students, postgraduate groups and very recently among staff scientists from all around the world through the SuperJEDI meeting in Mauritius in 2013. We propose to host JEDI workshops in Mauritius and Namibia for 2014."
"Latin American School of Observational Astronomy 2014",1,2014,"Mexico        ","There is great enthusiasm for astronomy in Latin America and even interest in developing small local observatories but, unfortunately, so far there are very few astronomers in these countries who can develop new talents. In collaboration with the Instituto Nacional de Astonomia, Optica y Electronica (INAOE), in 2007 members of the Astronomy Institute at the National University began a short course at our observatory in Tonanzintla dedicated to undergraduate-level students from these countries. The course was called the Escuela de Astronomia Observacional Centroamericana (Central American School of Observational Astronomy), and when it was later discovered that there was interest from other parts of Latin America, it was renamed the Latin American School of Observational Astronomy.
Tonanzintla was chosen to take advantage of the National University’s 1m telescope and, due to climate constraints, the three-week theoretical course with daily observational experience is offered only in the month of January. Professors from universities throughout Mexico are invited to give lectures and students observe nightly practicing the new techniques they have learned.
Since its inception 54 students have taken the course and many are now in graduate courses throughout the world. The observational part of the course has been enriched by the acquisition of smaller telescopes, but it needs to be further expanded with additional telescopes so that students can work in smaller groups.
Although the course is without cost for the students and we supply housing and food, the students are required to pay their own transportation to and from Mexico. Experience has shown that many participants often are unable to pay the airfare to Mexico and many have traveled here for days by bus.
We feel that to attract more students, relate to the economical/educational needs of each country and to guide those who take the course, it is necessary for us to visit local universities."
"Regional School on Astrophysical Data Reduction",1,2014,"Nepal        ","Tribhuvan University has been offered opportunity to carry out research work in A&A since 2006 at the Central Department of Physics (CDP), Kathmandu, Nepal. Till date 84 masters’ thesis have been completed in the various areas of Astrophysics. About two dozen masters’ theses are published in the Journals MNRAS, A&A, and Ap&SS. CDP has offered Ph.D. program in Astrophysics since 2010. At present, five students are involved in Ph.D. and 18 are doing work for their master’s dissertation. The research areas are mainly galaxy evolution, ISM and dark energy. Additional Information is available in http://astronepal.webs.com.
After completing masters’ thesis, about 50% students go abroad (mostly USA) for the further study and research in A&A. The remaining students go to various colleges in Nepal to teach physics and astronomy at undergraduate level. They use to forget what they learned during masters’ thesis because of their involvement in teaching. The aim of this school to group them and finally prepare them for Ph.D. project. In addition to these students, there are large number (more than 200) of masters’ students majoring Astrophysics every year. Last year we had organized 4 days workshop NWAA2013 (For detail: http://www.astro4dev.org/category/tf1/nepal-workshop/). This workshop left a strong impact not only on participants, but also to the authorities of University as well as Government of Nepal. Because of the effective outcome of NWAA2013 (supported by IAU), recently our department has convinced Government of Nepal to support this particular area in the year 2014.
We have decided to organize a regional workshop in order to provide an extensive learning environment to the participants of Nepal and neighboring countries. We will focus on database, data reduction and problem identification which is commonly used A&A research. Ultimately, a beginning of fruitful research collaboration is needed for the better future, in this region."
"Starlight in the university lab 2014",1,2014,"Belgium        ","This application concerns the continuation (year 2) of an previously approved project.
The project aims at fully developing and implementing a research tutorial, Astrolab, in universities in need of astronomy infrastructure and curriculum, allowing undergraduate students in sciences to perform real-time observations on a remote telescope, and transforming those observations into a scientific result.
The goal of this project is twofold :
a) to introduce students to the scientific research method in general by working scientifically through project development and preparation, data acquisition and treatment, analysis and conclusions.
b) to enhance interest in science studies by making them more attractive and getting the students involved in the “learning”.
The level is that of science students at an introductory astronomy course (1st or 2nd BSc), but can be adapted downwards as well as upwards.
Astrolab is implemented at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel since 5 years.
This project is a pilot one: it will first be developed in 2 partner universities, and after a test period of 3 years it could be implemented in various other universities."
"Sustainment of the development of astrophysics in Vietnam at the Master/PhD level in the  radio astronomy domain",1,2014,"Vietnam        ","The proposed project is to invite three foreign astronomers to spend a week in Hanoi (Vietnam) and give lectures and/or seminars on astrophysics, specifically in the field of radio astronomy. Two of these astronomers are presently thesis co-directors of two Vietnamese PhD students. The other is from China.
The audience will consist of the VATLY staff, a small astrophysics laboratory in Hanoi, and Vietnamese astrophysicists and students from other universities in Ha Noi and Sai Gon. The audience would be of 10 to 20 participants ranging from Master level to PhD. The organisation will be taken care of by the VATLY staff.
This project has two main goals:
1) to increase the knowledge and expertise of the Vietnamese radio astronomy community and to strengthen links both between themselves and with astronomers from abroad, both in the region and in Europe, in order to foster future collaborations.
2) to give the student the great opportunity to discuss face-to-face their current research in that field with experts in the field.
The ultimate goal would be to establish firm collaborative links with foreign institutions, including those in which Vietnamese students are presently working for their PhD."
"The Fourth East-African Astronomy Workshop",1,2014,"Rwanda        ","The series of workshops in Astronomy in East Africa began in 2009 during the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009). The first workshop was held in November 2009 in Nairobi, Kenya and was supported largely by the International Astronomical Union/ Teaching for Astronomy Developement (IAU/TAD), Developing Astronomy Globally (DAG), SAAO, University of Nairobi and the International Science Programmes (ISP- Upsalla University). Most of the resource persons were largely drawn from outside the region, including USA and South Africa. The second workshop was held in February 2011 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, while the third workshop was held in November 2012 in Kampala, Uganda. The resource persons in both workshops were drawn from USA, IAU/OAD, SAAO, SA SKA, African VLBI network project and from the South African DST.
The fourth workshop, being organized by the East African Astronomical Society (EAAS) is scheduled in May 2014 at Kigali-Rwanda.
The purpose of these workshops is to strengthen capacity building in Astronomy and Astrophysics and Space Science in general and also provide a forum for astronomers from the region to train young and upcoming scientists. It provides an opportunity for exchange of ideas, cross border co-supervision and sharing of resources. There already exists a Bachelor’s degree programme in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Nairobi, Kenya and a number of other universities in the region are in the process of curriculum development of the same. The Ethiopian Space Science Society is building two 1-m class optical telescopes at Entoto Observatory near Addis Ababa. There is also a project to transform old telecom dishes into radioastronomy antennas to make a strong VLBI African network.
None of the individual countries have enough manpower or the resources to run programmes in astronomy on their own and this calls for networking and sharing of expertise to teach and supervise students across East Africa."
"West African International Summer School for Young Astronomers 2014",1,2014,"Nigeria        ","The NASRDA Centre for Basic Space Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka in collaboration with the Dunlap Institute at the University of Toronto, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) and Institute for Science and Engineer Educators' (ISEE) at the University of California, Santa Cruz will organize an introductory summer school in astronomy for undergraduate science students in West Africa. This is the second year the summer school will be held. Currently, we are in the final planning stages for a summer school to be held October 21-25, 2013, and are seeking funds to continue the project in 2014.
Unlike similar schools, which focus just on scientific content, WAISSYA will combine lectures given by Nigerian faculty with interactive problem solving sessions and innovative, inquiry-based activities led by graduate student and postdoctoral fellow instructors from the University of Toronto. In inquiry-based teaching, students learn science concepts and skills by mimicking authentic scientific research, generally via a facilitated exploration of real data that is guided by the students’ own questions. Inquiry teaching methods have been shown by science education research to give students a deep, lasting understanding of the material covered in the school, rather than just a shallow overview, and to promote students’ scientific skills and self-identity as scientists (see references below).
We will use a practice known as “backwards design” — that is, establishing our learning goals and assessment metrics first, and then creating activities that will help students meet those goals. This means that assessment will remain a critical component throughout the activity, so that we can monitor how well our interventions work, both during and after the school."

The first Astroparty was held in 2005, when it was organized at regional level, but in this year its range has became wider.More and more people show interest in that party. Owing to it a lot of new Astronomy clubs are built up at regional level; the party itself rouses interest in Astronomy as a science and as a subject in school as well.
When taking part in the party students get more skills both in theory itself and in making watching experiments of space. They learn how to analize and describe such experiments. These activities are not held at schools competitions in Astronomy.
Astroparty contributes to the development of the regional and national policy of the Municipality of Dolna Mitropolia, the Pleven region and Bulgaria.It makes extra-curricular activities more attractive to students and makes the landmarks by the Danube riverside more popular in the region.

The key framework of “E-Teacher Training: Taking astronomy to the Portuguese Speaking Countries community” is sustainability: by training teacher trainers, the program will adapt and deliver astronomy educational resources, orienting the training for its use, for an ultimate and effective delivery in classroom. By the end of the project all trainers attending the program are equipped to train other teachers in these methodologies, leveraging the work begun in the virtual workshops, continuing the legacy of this project in future: the future continuous training of other teachers on site by the new teachers trained in the program.
Through astronomy exercises and cross-disciplinary resources the workshop delivered contents are already certified by other teaching communities around the world and this program will adapt them to each country specific science curricula and reach locations scarce in resources of their own, allowing them to have access to training that otherwise couldn’t have. We will use the open course methodology and through already established partnerships have cutting edge resources for this purpose all for free.

These projects were successful but on a local scale and targeted to groups of regular youngsters. However, in Poland such projects are necessary not only in cities like Toruń (circ. 200 000 residents) but mostly in small towns and villages. In these locations, children have much fewer opportunities to learn more about astronomy than the basics presented to them in schools. In most schools teachers don’t have funds, sometimes skills to conduct science projects or hands-on activities. Therefore, very early children are introduced to very strong stereotypes – science is theoretical, difficult and boring, In result, in small local communities in Poland level of science illiteracy is appallingly high, requiring quick and effective action. For this reason, both organizations decided to join forces and create join pilot project, acting on level higher that before.

Our sites rely on volunteers interacting with rich visual data in the web browser, that often requires websites that are sometimes megabytes in size. Zooniverse websites rely on users participating through modern web browsers on broadband-speed, home internet connections.
We propose to create a low-bandwidth, multi-lingual citizen science project, to be selected in 2014 from the Zooniverse’s open proposal system, based on its suitability for the goals of the project and its scientific merit. A call for projects should be made in advance, in coordination with the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development. With the Zooniverse’s high standards for research and design, the aim is to build a project that stands alongside existing sites such as Galaxy Zoo, Planet Hunters and the Milky Way Project.
The infrastructure and expertise in the Zooniverse’s growing web development team will support a developer in building a new citizen science website aimed at the developing world and optimised for low-bandwidth use. It will also act as a focal point in advancing Zooniverse efforts to provide projects in multiple languages and create connections with astronomers in developing countries.
This project will act as a pathfinder for the Zooniverse, allowing the development of new tools for the delivery of responsive websites. The techniques created in the development of this project will then be evaluated and integrated into the Zooniverse platform.

Newly established SKA SA research chairs in South Africa are attracting postgraduate students from all over Africa, while some are already involved in post-doctoral work and early career research. Astronomy courses are also taking off in SKA partner countries across Africa.
As in other fields of science, astronomers are under pressure to sustain public and political support for their discipline. Instead of asking whether they have the time or interest to engage public and policy audiences in their word, scientists are now realising that they can no longer afford NOT do to it.
It is therefore essential to equip young astronomers with the confidence and skills to engage a wide range of audiences, from young children to senior politicians, successfully. They will play a key role in sharing the inspirational value of astronomy and the bright future of this field with the rest of the continent’s people and youth.
This proposal seeks funding for the development and delivery of a three-day course focused on the challenges and opportunities of communicating astronomy, astrophysics and related engineering fields. The course will include training on how to deliver engaging popular talks (“Famelab” style) and how to write popular articles and blogs; as well as hands-on skills on how to prepare for and conduct radio, television and print media interviews. Delegates will also learn how they can package their research for maximum media appeal and how to use a range of social media platforms to engage new audiences. They will be introduced to innovative ways of sharing science via theatre, science cafés, music, etc. Case studies and evidence from successful astronomy communicators will provide an interactive component and role models.

Dozens of Vietnamese young amateur astronomers are happily joining hands to bring the space science tours to hundreds of students nationwide. The Vietnam outreach project is surely succeed with its commitments, and the project organisers are proud of being chosen by IAU-OAD, as the first beneficial country in the South East Asia region.It is the right time to make the next step, a continuous succesful extension: the phase two!
There have been about 20 astronomical clubs/societies since the dawn of Internet in Vietnam. From online forum boxes to small-sized organisations, their members experience the changes of Vietnam science. However, because of the generation gap, the knowledge disparity, the far distance, the lack of communications, the differences in operation, and other disadvantages have lead to the isolation of Vietnamese amateur astronomy. The clubs’ lives usually gone with their predecessor leaders, and do not have good planning, investment in a middle/long term vision. The idea is to maintain activities of local astronomy clubs throughout the country, and organise a national-level meeting for all/most of them to unite into one network. We will inspire new initiatives, receive real feedback, and all are expected to act under a same flag, for the best effeciency in astronomical knowledge dissemination, and in potential astronomers incubation."

"Nanotarium: The Most Inexpensive, Quality DIY Planetarium on Earth",3,2014,"Global        ","This project is to test and further develop small, inexpensive planetarium projectors, “Nanotariums,” to be made by astronomy educators and/or their students anywhere in the world. They feature educationally useful, single star field images that are projected using quality optics. They can project on any flat or curved surface at a scale useful for teaching small classes or demonstrating the night sky to small groups. Happily, they consume little power, so they can be run from a simple power adapter or even batteries.
In an age of expensive, sophisticated, high-end digital planetariums, Nanotariums project a stunning star field at a fraction of the cost. Bright, high color-temperature LEDs and the ability to easily create digital star fields for laser cutting of gobo star plates make this possible. The budgetary goal is to create a basic planetarium projector for approximately $50 US in parts.
An added bonus is that these projectors can eventually be offered as full or partial kits. The kits would include corollary information on the physics of optics and light on which the projectors depend. They can justifiably be termed a comprehensive DIY (Do It Yourself) STEM learning project, similar to those at Maker Faires.
The proof of concept for this mini-projection system was tested at Columbia College Chicago’s Summer 2013 informal ed program for high school students called Junior Research Scientists. This proposal hopes to take the projector one step further and to develop training materials and workshops for educators. These would be tested in Columbia’s community outreach programs in Chicago, at the International Planetarium Society (IPS) meeting in Beijing 2014, and, hopefully, at the IAU meeting in Hawaii, 2015."

Many minority regions have high percentage of illiteracy, low enrollment rate, and high dropout rate of school children. The amazing astronomy is an ideal tool to inspire people and their kids in those regions with the beauty of the modern science and to stimulate their interests to education.
The effectiveness of science popularization activities largely depends on its coverage in the population. Thus we propose a large-scale eight-year astronomical outreach strategy to cover all major cities in each prefecture of Yunnan province. With our proposed 'Astronomy for Development Week' events in several most populated cities of each prefecture, we will be able to illustrate our outreach coverage on an 'astronomical outreach footprint map'. We expect that, after the 8 years (2013-2020) of efforts, we will eventually be able to complete this outreach footprint map (high coverage of population) and to arouse widespread public interests in science and education in the whole Yunnan province. We also will try to update our outreach activity contents and improve effectiveness assessment methods year by year to enhance the impact to the local people.
Simultaneously, we will execute a parallel procedure within which we will compile the local astronomical culture resources such as minority calendar in or near the cities where we do outreach. Such compilation will not only help us to tailor our outreach activities to fit the interests of the local people, but enable us to share the astronomy related local minority culture with other regions or countries."
"Andean Cosmology School",1,2015,"Colombia        ","We will host a one month school on the theoretical, numerical and observational aspects of cosmology. The school will bring together 4 researchers of international expertise and 25 students from Latin-America.
The school will present current methods and research problems in cosmology. With this goal in mind it will tackle not only basic theoretical aspects, but also more advanced numerical and observational techniques. The school will have a focus on the physics of tracers of large scale structure in the Universe and their interest for cosmological application. Furthermore, we have aimed at a large duration for the school. This has the purpose of giving time to the students to create friendship ties and delve deeply into the concepts presented in the school.
In this project we seek funding to give grants to fully cover the accommodation and subsidize the costs of meals for 10 students coming from countries different than Colombia. This funding will be key to reach the goal of having a wide range of students from the continent."
"Astronomy for Africa: Student Support for Astronomy Modules via Distance Learning",1,2015,"South Africa Global       ","This is a pilot project to support students all over Africa who want to study Astronomy but where the university in their home country does not offer astronomy courses.
Most universities offer a standard BSc degree in physics, but well-taught astronomy courses are difficult to find in Africa due to the lack of a larger astronomy community. However, in the event of the SKA coming to South Africa and a few other African countries as well as the African VLBI Network (AVN) which has been initiated by the SKA- SA project office and which involves a number of African countries, it is important to offer the possibility of a degree in Astronomy to all African students. Members of the East African Astronomical Society in particular are keen to expose more students to astronomy during their university studies.
African students could obtain a bursary and go to a university abroad to study astronomy, but it would be much more cost-effective and flexible to a person's circumstances if the student could stay at a university in their home country, attend all the physics and mathematics courses required, and register for the required astronomy courses at a university that offers distance learning. The University of South Africa, UNISA, is such a university. There is a precedence case, a collaboration with the University of Free State (UFS) whereby any undergrad modules in astronomy passed through UNISA are counted as electives towards the student's BSc degree at UFS.
In other words, the students will be full students registered at a university in their home country and only register for the astronomy modules at UNISA. The university fees at UNISA are reasonably cheap for South African standards, but even these fees are often too high for other African countries. We therefore propose to support a number of students to pay for the UNISA fees for the astronomy modules which, if recognised by the host university, will count as modules towards a BSc degree."
"Guatemalan School of Astrophysics 2015",1,2015,"Guatemala        ","The GUAtemalan School of Astrophysics (GUASA) aims to bring together local Central American/Caribbean undergraduate students of physics/mathematics/engineering, with experts from prestigious astronomical institutions from around the world. During each edition, we expect to cover a wide range of modern topics of astrophysics in order to motivate the students to pursue major degrees in astronomy elsewhere. We hope that this school will contribute to create a critical mass of professional astronomers/astrophysicists in the region along with the conditions needed for research, thus leading to the creation of strong astrophysics departments in the Universities of the region. In the future, after a few editions of GUASA, we hope to be able to include lecturers from the local academic community. As a complementary activity of every edition of GUASA, we also want to organize outreach activities for the general public, such as public lectures followed by observations using small telescopes. These activities we hope, will encourage children and teenagers to get closer to science and to continue their studies aiming for superior education. Guatemala, along with many countries of the Central American/Caribbean region, lacks of a solid and well consolidated program of astronomy/astrophysics at Graduate level. The GUASA school aims to trigger the change needed to improve upon that situation. We believe that after undertaking a few editions of the GUASA school, this pattern can substantially change by training and motivating good students to enroll them in higher education programs while we campaign the local authorities in favour of the creation of new opportunities to recover their now highly trained and educated professionals."
"Introducing Data Analysis in the University System",1,2015,"Zambia South Africa       ","There is now a new paradigm in astronomy where data from large missions have become accessible to anyone with good computer hardware and access to the internet. In many ways, this has opened up frontier science to those institutions and countries who have not been in the scientific mainstream. However, there is still a significant bar to entry in that the techniques to access and analyze the data can be opaque and poorly documented.
We propose to introduce astronomical data analysis into the university curriculum with the goal of enabling students and faculty to participate in new initiatives, including the upcoming SKA partnership of which Zambia is a partner. This is particularly relevant now that the Southern African Regional Node has been established at Copperbelt University and we expect that the modules and teaching techniques developed here will be applicable to the entire region.
This will have two parts. The first is an introduction to the software and bibliographic tools, including but not limited to Aladin, Simbad, ADS and GDL, used in everyday astronomical data analysis and the second is an introduction to the available data, primarily SDSS and GALEX. The Project Lead has been involved with big data both in his personal research and in disseminating the techniques through the university system. He will spend approximately 6 months spread over two years at Copperbelt University with visits to other institutions in the Southern African region as required.
Big data has now become part of the lexicon of all fields of science and business and astronomy, especially, has been in the forefront of creating and utilizing huge multi-parameter data sets. The skills developed in handling and in interpreting these data sets are applicable to many different professions where critical thinking and a basic understanding of real-world data are important."

The proposed school will be the third but very important step that will combine and extend both previous schools. In this school, participants (Ph.D. and masters’ thesis student) will learn the nature of simulations that has been used in the Astrophysics research in recent days. Participants will use PYTHON to write program for SIMULATION using input parameters that will be taken from database. We plan to use SDSS (Sloan Dizitized Sky Survey) DR7-DR10 database of about 20 Supercluster galaxies (Liivamagi et al. 2012, A&A 539, A80; Aryal et al. 2013, MNRAS, 434, 1939) and find expected isotropic distribution curves by performing Monte Carlo simulation for the galaxy orientation study. We intend to publish this effort. Till date, no attempts has been made to study the preferred orientation of angular momentum vectors of SDSS Supercluster galaxies. The objectives of NSAS are as follows: (1) The purpose of this school teach problem identification skill (literature review) to the M.Sc. and Ph.D. students of Nepal. (2) A method of problem solving procedure (simulation/computation) will be taught by using SDSS DR7-DR10 database of galaxies. (3) A Monte Carlo Simulation will be performed in the school to find expected isotropic distributions concerning galaxy orientation. (4) A database of 12 Superclusters (Liivamagi et al. 2012, A&A 539, A80) will be analysed in order to test nonrandom effects in the galaxy alignments. (5) The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experienced as well as young Astrophysics M.Sc. and Ph.D. students of Nepal. In this school we intend study extragalactic astrophysics concerning galaxy orientation and will interpret our simulations in the frame work of the different galaxy evolution models namely Hierarchy, Turbulence, and Pancake."
"Optical camera for a 14-inch telescope in Namibia",1,2015,"Namibia        ","This project is centered on purchasing an optical camera for the use with a 14-inch telescope in Windhoek, Namibia.
Namibia is home to the world’s largest gamma-ray experiment, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) project. Also, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope will partly be constructed in Namibia and in other several African partner countries. Against this background, the country has been aspiring to engage in serious human capital development programs in astronomy to enable the locals to partake in these world leading scientific experiments. The Department of Physics of the University of Namibia (UNAM) has been spearheading this process. However, the science goals for both H.E.S.S. and the SKA are so advanced that it presents a challenge to train local students at undergraduate level to directly feed into these experiments without some sort of intermediated educational and observational astronomy program.
For this purpose, we intent to use a close-by, privately owned observatory, known as the Cuno Hoffmeister Memorial Observatory (CHMO). The main instrument of CHMO is a 14-inch Schmitt-Cassegrain reflector telescope, with currently has no optical camera. Our intention is to acquire an optical camera for it and use it to perform photometric observations of various astronomical sources. The ultimate goal is to gear the Namibian community towards cutting-edge research in multi-wavelength astronomy involving optical, gamma-ray and radio wavelength regimes. This project will also serve as an introductory and intermediate program in which students are introduced to observational astronomy, data reduction and data analysis from which they can acquire the necessary skills to get involved in high level research with H.E.S.S. and the SKA. The owner of CHMO, Mrs. Sonja Itting-Enke, has for decades been committed to astronomy education for schools and the public and is eagerly looking forward to cooperate with UNAM in making use of this observatory."
"Summer School on Statistical Data Analysis and Data Mining in Astronomy",1,2015,"Kenya        ","There is a rapidly growing interest in astronomy and astrophysics in Kenya and the East African region. One of the SKA nodes will be located in Kenya and an observatory for optical astronomy has already been commissioned at Entoto in Ethiopia. These developments provide great opportunities for local students and researchers to get involved in as well as initiate their astronomy research projects. However, there are very few experts in astronomy and astrophysics in the east African region, and even less expertise in how to process, understand, and exploit astronomical data. We propose to hold a summer school at Kenyatta University focusing on statistical data analysis and data mining in astronomy. This will be achieved through lectures and hands-on exercises given by international experts. The target group is students at the MSc and PhD level from the East African region (Kenya, Burundi, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda) although students from across the world are also welcome. Building on what they learn at this workshop, East African students will be able to make valuable contributions to astrophysics with a minimum of hardware resources, by applying advanced data analysis and interrogation methods on modest computing resources to the numerous astronomical data sets which are publicly available. We believe that this will set an important foundation for the establishment of long term expertise in astronomy in East Africa. The main objective of this project is to transfer fundamental knowledge and skills in astronomy to postgraduate students in Kenya and the region. This will enable them to actively participate in international research projects as well as initiate research projects of their own, also in collaboration with international partners. Astronomy is a small field, and such international connections are essential if East African astronomy is to thrive and grow"
"Summer Visiting Program for Astronomers at  the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA)",1,2015,"United States        ","The importance of mobility of scientists for their careers is unquestionable. However, for researchers from economically developing countries, visiting a world-renowned institution is something they can only dream of, not because of lack of talent or ambition, but because of lack of opportunities and gateways.
We propose a pilot program in which astronomers from economically developing countries can apply to spend a month in the summer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Scientists from economically developing countries worldwide can apply for this opportunity. In their application, they have to present a work plan and outline the benefits of their visit for the continuation of their career and the development of astronomy back in their home country. In a pilot program, two visiting scientists will be selected for the summer of 2015. We foresee mutual benefit from such a visiting program for both the visiting scientist and the CfA scientists and staff, who will have the opportunity to learn from the visitors about the status of astronomy in their countries. From such visits lasting collaborations can grow that open up increasing exchange in knowledge, contribution to education (e.g., workshops/schools later organized in the country of the visitor), and increased integration, all high priorities for the International Astronomical Union and its Office of Astronomy for Development."
"TARA, Fergusson College Node, Pune, India",1,2015,"India         ","Fergusson College has been actively engaged in science popularization in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the past 18 years with simple and limited facilities. Recently, the Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics IUCAA, Pune has officially acknowledged us with a IUCAA Node for Astronomy and Astrophysics Development i.e. INAAD center for further popularization of the subject among undergraduates. The Physics Department also has Astronomy and Astrophysics as an elective subject at Undergraduate and Post graduate level. Presently we are involved in setting up an observatory as we already have a 9.25 inch Celestron with go to facility. We have procured grants for purchase of Photometer, CCD and a Solar Telescope. The Cork Institute of Technology, Ireland, recently visited the college for possibilities of a collaborative project in setting up a Robotic Telescope using the existing facility. They have a robotic telescope operating at Cork and California, US which are linked. The TARA Fergusson College node will thus allow students to carry out projects and research in various disciplines using the setup for remote observations. The node would also let students and teachers use this telescope for live observing sessions as well as scheduled observations. Further, the difference in time zones between USA, Ireland, India is also ideal for day time astronomy – Solar studies. An integral part of the project will also be the implementation of a public outreach scheme to allow schools and other colleges to utilize the robotic telescope system as a learning and inspirational tool. Students will learn remote observation techniques and carry out remote observations. The TARA node will provide a unique opportunity for college students, in India, Ireland and USA to perform observations, manually as well as remotely and to stimulate interest in Physics, Electronics&Astronomy/Astrophysics.http://www.bco.ie/tara/the-story-of-tara/"
"Time Variability in Modern Astrophysics",1,2015,"Thailand        ","We plan to organize a workshop aimed at astronomers of all levels, who wish to improve their skills in specilized subjects of observation and data reduction. The primary target will be young researchers from South-East Asian countries, who will learn during NIATW how to use instrumentation of a level not readily available elsewhere in the region, and find opportunities to initiate know-how and collaboration links.
This NIATW will be the first of a series of such workshops, that NARIT aspires to organize as part of its strategy to become a leading astronomical institution in South-East Asia, and to provide resources and support for the development of astronomy in the region (eg, NARIT hosts the Regional Node of the OAD for South-East Asia). The first NIATW will be themed ""Time Variability in Modern Astrophysics"" and will make use of the newly inaugurated 2.4m Thai National Telescope to address a number of phenomena subject to time variability. The combination of: telescope size (sufficiently powerful but not yet subject to an excessive pressure factor), geographical location (South-East Asia does not have any comparable facility, and this longitude range is in general poorly covered), instrumentation (including fast and very fast photometry to rates not available elsewhere in the region) makes the TNT an ideal site for such a workshop. We also stress that the event will be in the local ""dry season"" with a high chance of clear skies. We plan to schedule the NIATW a few months after the ISYA (International School for Young Astronomers, also hosted by NARIT in Nov-Dec 2014) so that in fact we may attract some of the ISYA participants to come back and continue observations in the context of NIATW.
Thailand offers the opportunity to easily bring together researchers from many countries, at a moderate cost, in a friendly environment and pleasant climate."
"AstroMcGill's Adopt an Astronomer program",2,2015,"Canada        ","AstroMcGill, the astronomy outreach group at McGill University, requests funds to support a new program called “Adopt an Astronomer”. This program will send McGill University’s young professional astronomers (graduate students or post-doctoral researchers) to primary school classrooms around Québec, multiple times a year. In other words, each partner classroom will “adopt” their own astronomer, interacting with her/him on multiple occasions during the school year. In addition, each astronomer will be matched with one of McGill’s Faculty of Education pre-service/in-service teachers, forming pairs visiting the same classroom throughout the program duration. The goals of this program are two-fold:
- Educational: it will provide science mentors to school children, inspiring them to pursue a life-long love of science while teaching and promoting important astronomy concepts.
- Pedagogical: it will foster the exchange of skills between the pre-service/in-service teachers (pedagogy, how to engage young children, etc...) and the professional astronomers (knowledge of astronomy and science).
These free classroom visits will consist of multiple hands-on, fun astronomy activities and scientific experiments held in the classrooms. The creation and funding of this unique program will open new opportunities for science promotion in Québec. Funding from the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development will be used to cover the cost of transportation to and from the primary schools as well as the cost of materials for the first year of operation, allowing to evaluate the impact of such a program. With the budget requested, we plan to reach over 500 students in the first year, and possibly more in the following years."

These materials will be used by the Organization for Science Education and Observatory situated in Arusha, Tanzania. Each ambassador will be responsible for a science subject (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography or Mathematics) to develop astro-science activities and disseminate these to other teachers and schools.
The Astro-Science Ambassador Outreach project is unique and innovative because it is a model for inquiry based science education that has the support of Tanzanian Ministry of Education Regional Officers, local educators, and community members. It is based in Northern Tanzania focusing on the work of the Organization for Science Education and Observatory in Usa River. The project will take astro-science knowledge and skills to more teachers, students, schools and government officers in Arusha region of northern Tanzania.
The project will make use of the activities developed by astro-science ambassadors during the astro-science curriculum development workshop in June, 2014. It will use the resources distributed by Telescopes to Tanzania, UNAWE-Tanzania and the Organization for Science Education and Observatory to reach out to schools in the Arusha/Meru region and practice the new activities with the teachers and education officers.
By the end of the project we will reach 24 schools, 48 teachers, engage 2 government district education officers and reach up to 1000 students from the region. The project looked to be pilot to the rest of the regions within Tanzania for the government to scale up as well as to other countries in East Africa, in observing the role of astronomy in promoting science and development."

Over the past 4 years, we have reached over 750 teachers and informal educators from all across Canada with extremely positive comments and feedback. Our typical workshop lasts three weeks and includes a weekly webinar on different subject plus activities for participants to do on their own. Everything is accessible on the internet and the webinar can be watched synchronously or asynchronously (recording). All our activities are offered in French and English.
While our programs are offered to Canadian educators, we usually get a few international participants, especially in our French workshops. This brought the idea of offering an international workshop for teachers. Since it is harder to find good French resources in astronomy online, we would focus our efforts on a French workshop to begin. As we are already running such webinars, we could use our existing website and resources and adapt them to an international audience.
Our plan is therefore:
• To offer a FREE 3-week online workshop for teachers covering basic concepts in astronomy (motions of the Earth, moon, solar system, observing the night sky...);
• This workshop would be offered entirely via the internet, with a weekly webinar. We also offer activities do to in class as well as digital resources (slides, images, links to interesting websites...).
• Our marketing strategy would be to reach many French-speaking teachers from developing countries, especially in Africa.

Since its creation, GM has organised expeditions to Chile, Bolivia and Peru (2009), Bolivia (2012), India (2012), Uganda (2013), Brazil and Bolivia (2014), and extended actions in Portugal (2012,2013), Nepal (2013) and the United States (2013), reaching over 10,300 students and 1,500 teachers. With its Constellation project, GM aims to establish a South American network of schools committed to the long- term organisation of astronomical outreach activities amongst their pupils and local communities, and to provide the teachers of those schools with the material, training and support required to do so.Each school in the network will benefit from: - the donation of educational material and telescopes; - a personalised long-distance training program for all educators involved; - a plan of outreach activities to be carried out at the schools throughout the school year; - a two-day visit by the GM team, involving outreach activities and teacher training workshops; - access to an online platform created especially for the network, which will facilitate interactions among the schools and with GM. The project will involve twenty-one schools in seven countries (Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina), directly reaching at least 100 teachers and 6,000 students. Thanks to the long-term sustainability of the project, more students will benefit from the project through events organised independently by the schools.

In Cosmos, Carl Sagan shared the process by which Eratosthenes measured the angle of the shadow cast at local noon when sunlight strikes a stick positioned perpendicular to the ground. By comparing his measurement to another made a distance away, Eratosthenes was able to calculate the circumference of the earth. (See Carl Sagan's depiction of this process at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8cbIWMv0rI.) We will provide an online learning environment where students will be able to do science the same way Eratosthenes did. A notable project in which this was done was The Eratosthenes Project, conducted in 2005 as part of the World Year of Physics; in fact, we will be drawing on the teacher's guide (http://www.physics2005.org/projects/eratosthenes/TeachersGuide.pdf) developed by that project. The difference between that activity and How Big Is Earth? is the online learning environment provided by the iCollaboratory where teachers and students can collaborate, share data, and reflect on their learning of science and astronomy. We will also maintain and share an ongoing database of student measurements. We will collect data on both teacher and student learning from surveys, discussions, and self-reflection done online. Students in each school will collaborate with students around the world; during the first year, schools in six countries will participate. We will share our research about the kinds of learning that takes place only in global collaborations. This is a sustainable project. Another ongoing annual project in the iCollaboratory, The Moon Over Us, has grown from 5,000 students in 2 countries to 6,000 students in 6 countries; total number of students participating has been 15,000.

We propose to outreach through camel cart exhibitions, hands-on activities, posters, kits and films in Dediapada, Nandod, Sagbara and Tilakwada talukas of Narmada District of Gujarat State. This district is a tribal district with several people from economic backward regions a socially excluded population in several villages. Under this project we propose to outreach material to the beneficiaries from all the segments of society. We believe that SCIENCE IS FOR ALL. We plan to outreach Astronomy in the form of a Travelling exhibition on Camel Cart to more than 150,000 people from the district. The outreach will be carried out in 3 phases:
Phase 1: Introduction to Astronomy
Phase 2: Let us learn more about Astronomy
Phase 3: Astronomy and Light
Under this project we have planned to communicate astronomy at Children, School and Community level. We have planned to visit almost 80 villages in an outreach period of 30 days. We will be working with 2 Camel cart exhibitions.
We are sure this project would turn out very interesting results in the area of Astronomy Communication. With the locally available infrastructure and the support from IAU this would be a benchmark project not only on on national level but international level."
"COSMIC LIGHT: BRING GALILEO'S STARRY MESSENGER TO VIETNAM",3,2015,"Vietnam        ","The last two IAU grants has done something that is unprecedented: we manage to get the entire amateur astronomy communities together to work together and enjoy astronomy together. The two annual meetings have attracted almost 100 participants from more than 10 cities each times. We are also proud to provide students resources to astronomy & space educational programs in Vietnam and abroad. Among all astronomy and space students who are studying in Vietnam or abroad, almost half of them grew up from these amateur clubs. The science and technology platform in Vietnam is still very much primitive. Considering the emotion and the expectation of students from the last two years events, we believe that astronomy is the key to waken up the awareness of Vietnamese, especially the youth, for science and technology. Taking the chance that next year is the international year of light, we are going to organise a nation-wide activities to nurture the children's love of the sky. Beside the normal activities as last years, we plan to deploy two new activities. The first one is to translate and publicise the Galileo's masterpiece ""Sidereus Nuncius"" into Vietnamese (draft can be found here: www.cita.utoronto.ca/~qnguyen/starrymessengerVN.pdf) besides distributing Galileo telescope and teaching the public to make the Galileo telescope. The second activity is inviting two prominent Vietnam expatriat astronomers: Jane Luu (discoverer of the Kuiper Belt Object) and Nguyen Trong Hien (BICEP2 instrumentation group supervisor) to participate with us in reaching out to students. They are the two most influential astronomers to the public in Vietnam right now. Another important work is to maintain the union of all amateur clubs."

As part of the radio program we have also started a new project to help the public familiarize themselves with the night skies (“Un Paseo por el Cielo” - A Stroll About the Sky). It consists of four 50-60 minute audio recordings in which we help the observers orient themselves in the night sky and describe the location, shapes and mythologies of the constellations available that particular season. We decided to apply our learned radio communication skills and thus create an audio that can be listened to at the same time as looking up at the night sky. To our knowledge there is no such resource available in Spanish.
We are asking for funds to continue the radio show ́s web presence (podcast site maintenance) for the next three years, and to help cover the costs of production (writing, recording, editing and CD manufacturing) of the audio shows. Both products will be freely available to the general public."
"Poetry and Sky Competition",3,2015,"China        ","Our ancestors were closer to the night sky than we are. Celestial objects are mentioned in many Chinese ancient poems. But few people know them when they recite the poetry. The sky nearly never changes. We see the same sky as Li Bai, a Chinese famous poet, did 1200 years ago. In 2013, OAD supported the Chinese Ancient Poetry Astrophotography which encourages people to take pictures of the night sky according to ancient Chinese poems.
We organized the Chinese Ancient Poetry Astrophotography Competition (CAPAC) in 2014.
We launched the opening ceremony and received Congratulation Video from Mr. Kevin Govender, director of IAU OAD and handwriting from China Former Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao. We developed the website (http://hellosky.lamost.org) as the platform of the competition. The website provides many Chinese ancient astronomy poems, articles, and lecture videos which will help people join the competition. People can submit images and explanation during submission period and vote during the voting period online. We created columns on Amateur Astronomy magazine and social Medias to advertise the project.
Now, the first phase focusing on the Moon has finished. There are 52 entries selected from 96 images. The deadline of second phase submitting period is Sep. 10th; we have received more than 100 pictures. And the website home page has had more than 36000 hits. The project had been presented in IPS 2014 and APRIM2014 and got many congratulations: a wonderful and beautiful OAD TF project!
We will launch CAPAC awards and exhibition opening ceremony on Dec. 26, 2014.
We want to expand the project for the International Year of Light 2015. While continuing with the CAPAC, we will add Sky Poetry Competition (SPC). Let the participants select the image from A Universe of Images (project of IYL2015) and then write poems for them. So the project new name is Poetry and Sky Competition, it will help more people to appreciate the ancient and modern sky."
"Public Library Astronomy Corners",3,2015,"South Africa        ","
The SAAO (South African Astronomical Observatory) library wants to create astronomy awareness in our communities. The idea is to identify ten public libraries (5 per Province) per annum and create astronomy corners. This will be done in conjunction with the Department of Sports, Arts and Culture Western Cape and Northern Cape and the City of Cape Town Library Services and Northern Cape Provincial Library services as public libraries report to these departments. The project will only benefit the Western Cape and Northern Cape Provinces and when established and sustainable, it will be rolled out to other provinces too.
The SAAO library shall supply all books and informative material to the identified libraries and also include an astronomy training workshop for the ten librarians. The librarians have to dedicate a week or month to astronomy and have activities with the children as per the training supplied by the SAAO. Feedback reports have to be submitted.
We are aware that astronomy is part of primary school curricula. Communities in previous disadvantaged areas are always left behind with less growth, especially in science and technology development. The aim of this project is to create science awareness, with emphasis on astronomy in these communities. Educating children from a younger age in astronomy will grow love and passion for the field and soon new emerging young astronomers will be visible."
"SENSOROTECA ASTRONÓMICA",3,2015,"Colombia        ","What is a Sensoroteca?
A Sensoroteca is a space in which objects that can be perceived through taste, hearing, smell, touch and sight are stored. This is the same concept as a library structure but in this case, instead of carrying the contents are objects and materials.
How is a Sensoroteca used?
The Sensoroteca contains a catalog of objects with which you can make presentations and activities on a topic with an emphasis on multi-sensory character.
Who is it for?
The Sensoroteca is directed to different populations with disabilities, minorities, children, and seniors.
In the Planetario de Bogota, astronomy is the main theme that guides the activities performed in their facilities. The Sensoroteca Astronomica objects will be equipped to allow discuss issues with space, physics, chemistry and general cosmography, which can be perceived by taste, hearing, smell, touch and sight.
Thus, if at our Space Museum or at our Childrens Room, a guide wants to talk about black holes, you can choose from the available collection of objects those that are related to explain his speech. As such objects may sound, touch, see, smell and perhaps tasted, allow both deaf, the blind, who do not speak Spanish, infants or coming from regions and isolated groups, to interact with concepts and objects involved in this activity.
Some examples of the objects and materials are tactile spheres, space sounds, a universe of odors, kinetic astronomy, heat and cold, infrared astronomy, models, among others.
The purpose of these activities where multisensoriality is incorporated, is not to create experts in astronomical topics, but raise concerns that awaken interests that promote learning of various kinds."
"Sign Language Universal Encyclopedic  Dictionary",3,2015,"Global        ","Based on the proposal by Proust (2009) and collaborator as part of the IYA2009, this project proposes the dissemination of a unique language for the deaf worldwide, associated with astronomical terms.
While celestial objects are varied and the project can be expanded easily, the proposal will take especial attention to the basic terms linked with the IYL2015, for example light, light year, star, Sun, among others, but as this is a general project, we propose a complete “Sign Language Universal Dictionary”
As part of a new cellebration where the Light is involved, the proposal can reach more visibility and can contribute to share all the people on the Globe under the same way to name the astronomical object, instruments, and discoveries using the sign language.
The development of this universal sign language of astronomical terms, the related multimedia material and the encycopedic dictionary will be very useful specially for OAD activities which are carried out in a variety of developing countries with different languages, making it possible to carry out the same activities anywhere without the need of them being translated.

"US National Park Service Night Skies Internship",3,2015,"United States        ","The United States National Park Service (NPS) aims to create an internship for a current astronomy student or recent astronomy graduate to develop their leadership in astronomy communication while simultaneously enhancing the public outreach programs of the parks.
Over the course three months, the intern will collaborate with 1-3 National Parks, leading astronomy outreach programs and acting as an astronomy liaison for the park interpretive rangers and astronomy volunteers. In this time, the intern will contribute their knowledge of astronomy with park staff, while learning the interpretive philosophies of NPS. The internship will conclude with up to one month of collaboration at the NPS Night Skies Division at their headquarters in Fort Collins, Colorado, where the intern will assist with special projects at the national level.
This internship will serve as a pilot project for a larger initiative to link astronomy, physics, planetary science and cultural astronomy majors and graduates to public lands. Dark night skies are an increasingly rare part of our national heritage, and through this internship we aim to connect astronomy students and the public with this valuable resource.
The NPS may have the largest public astronomy effort of any other organization in the United States. An estimated 400,000 – 600,000 visitors annually participate in astronomy-related presentations, including ranger talks, telescope viewing, and other interactive programs. Since 2009 the NPS Night Skies Team has grown in coordination and support of these events, and park managers are finding that such programs are increasingly in high demand.
The extensive scope of our outreach and the continued growth of these programs necessitates the implementation of structures that will help advance the quality of these programs. The NPS Night Skies Internship Program will address this concern while simultaneously allowing for the growth of scientific communication skills of a young astronomer."

To achieve this, we will conduct activities in schools in the North and South of the border as well as bring the children together at the Home for Cooperation, a neutral space in the United Nations controlled ""buffer zone"", to engage in astronomy activities and explore the cosmos together. This will facilitate the goal of bringing together people from the different communities of Cyprus “under the same sky”, to construct bonds based on similarities, rather than focusing on our differences.

"Cosmic Code: First Contact",2,2017,"South Africa Zimbabwe Botswana      ","Coding is the language of the 21st century, where nearly everything in modern society is driven by coding. Astronomy is no exception, where coding is used to explore the universe. Whether it is through telescopes, satellites or robots exploring planets, coding is an essential instrument of astronomy.
The Cosmic Code: First Contact is a project that aims to introduce coding within an astronomy setting to the rural communities of Zululand (and beyond!). Many of these communities have not had any first-hand experience with information technologies, such as computers. This project will serve as the first point of contact, introducing the communities to computers through coding. The programme will entail a workshop in which participants will programme miniature Raspberry Pi robots using Python coding. The workshop begins with developing some of the soft skills of computing and coding through Scratch (pictorial code). From this level the workshop will proceed into using Python coding (written code). By combining the Python coding with Raspberry Pi robots, it allows the participants to see tangible applications of the code they write. This has a direct link to how astronomy uses coding to control planetary exploring robots or orbiting satellites. The programme will be aimed mainly at school children but will also be offered to young adults and the elderly. The Cosmic Code programme will also include a detailed workshop on career advice as to ensure the programme does not simply stop at making people aware of coding but ultimately makes coders of them! The project will engage and partner with other organisations such as Africa Code Week. The programme aims to expand the workshop to other countries such as Botswana and Zimbabwe.

"Hands on Basic Space Science training for Primary and Junior Secondary School Science Teachers",2,2017,"Nigeria        ","HBSST is a workshop designed to Promote Interest for Astronomy for Astronomy appreciation for primary schools and junior secondary school science teachers in Nigeria and to bring the basic observational tools of Astronomy and space science closer to them.
In 2015, through the effort of the Centre for Basic Space Science Nsukka, in Nigeria, Astronomy has recently been accredited in the primary and Secondary School Teaching Curriculum. This would be a unique opportunity to offer specialized training in Astronomy to teachers, since education at primary school and secondary school level is in a developing state. Astronomy unawareness will cause serious harm to technological society, thus our younger generation and the teachers should be exposed to this interesting field of science.
In Africa, especially Nigerian, we have myth, superstitious beliefs, anxiety, fear, misconception etc relating to many astronomical events, and to eradicate all these misconceptions, we need a strong science movement through Astronomical popularization/workshops at the grass root level. These teacher hands on training will aim at upgrading the skills, teaching tools and aids of these teachers, equipping them with innovative and simple method of teaching and learning. The teachers will also be trained to use Basic Space Sciences activities as a teaching tool for their subject’s concepts. The course material will include Astronomy based activities and hands on science/astronomy using low cost/locally available material. The 3-day workshop which we intend to carry out to cover Teachers from all Primary and Secondary School Nigeria, will encompass talks, hands on activities, demonstrations, Water rocket building and launching, Construction of small optical Telescopes using locally made materials, observation using a small optical telescope, Eclipse and Solar system model making, planetarium, Solarscope, Experiments and demonstrations using Universe in a Box apparatus, group work and innovation as well as public outreach.

"Looking ...Up! Astronomy for ALL",2,2017,"Greece        ","The project “Looking ...Up! Astronomy for All” (Up4All) aims to promote inclusive astronomy education. In order the project’s goal to be achieved Up4All will organize the follow activities: a) open to public Observational Days in Special Education Schools (in the wider region of Thessaloniki/ Central Makedonia / Greece) , b) Workshops for Teachers on how Astronomy can be integrated in terms of formal and non-formal learning, using innovative teaching tools and c) Workshop for teachers on creating educational astronomical videos.
A numerous of Special Education Schools will be the center of the open to public Observational Days bringing together students of typical development and students with special educational needs and/or disabilities and also of fun hands-on activities – like treasure hunt, tablets, “Meet our neighbours ” from astroedu, “Barycentric Balls” from ESA, etc– will be implemented engaging students with core concepts of astronomy while having fun.
Moreover, in order to highlight the need of integrate innovative teaching of the Astronomy in the curriculum and to give to teachers all the tools necessary for integrating Astronomy on their educational scenario, two types of Workshops will be held: a) Workshop for Teachers (in Greek) in parallel of Observational Days at Special Education Schools and b)Two (2), two-days Workshops for Teachers (in English), one on Media in science teaching practice – Movies on Astronomy at School and one on Video – software & apps / Video & Astronomy.
“Looking ...Up! Astronomy for All” project will be implemented with the collaboration of NUCLIO (http://nuclio.org), Greek Educational Radio-Television (EduTV - http://www.edutv.gr/) and INCLUDE (http://include-edu.blogspot.gr/p/include-s-cv.html) as coordinator, as well with the participation of distinguished European Teachers and Scientists. Finally, we want our project to be a 'pilot' and to spread the knowledge gained / to other countries eg Croatia, Spain, Portugal., etc, looking for potential collaborators.

"Gaza Ambassadors of Universe",3,2017,"State of Palestine / Gaza Strip        ","Astronomy gives us a chance to travel through the sky and to strongly break down the siege. As Palestinian youth we want to give our people hope, passion, and desire to live. We aim to raise awareness of astronomy knowledge in our society through an organized challenges that excites the astronomical passion, and love inside astronomy amateur’s heart. We will integrate technology, the jewel of the time, with Astronomy through a three-day boot camp challenge between 40 astronomy-related ideas. International and local mentors will select the best three ideas in order to be incubated for an intensive astronomical workshops implemented by the organizers."
"Naval Hill Planetarium: Context-approrpriate Content Development Project",3,2017,"South Africa        ","The Naval Hill Planetarium is presently the only digital planetarium in South Africa. Planetarium patrons come from vastly diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. In order to make pre-rendered shows (typically produced in developed countries in the northern hemisphere) accessible and relevant, we need to produce supporting full dome planetarium content and translate existing content so that we have at least two full dome films in two indigenous languages which include Sesotho. We also need to develop our own original content. The project will focus on developing new content that will be culturally relevant and speak to the needs of the local population and also focus on Southern African astronomical projects of international stature. In addition, the project will ensure that we develop the capacity (human resources) to produce our own content in the future, thereby making us less reliant on very expensive licenses, and keeping our planetarium offerings fresh. The Iziko Planetarium in Cape Town will soon be upgraded to house a similar digital planetarium projection system as that of the Naval Hill Planetarium. Thus, any planetarium content that we develop that appeals to the South African context has the potential to be used in the Iziko Planetarium as well as our planetarium. We have for example already produced an Afrikaans sound track for the ESO full dome film From the Earth to the Universe. Staff from the Iziko Planetarium indicated that they will find this very useful. The next step, as part of this project, is to produce a Sesotho and possibly also a Xhosa sound track for this film."
"Open Design Dark Sky Simulator",3,2017,"Globally        ","The idea is to design a physical simulator that will demonstrate the effects of light pollution on the sky and the difference that well-designed lighting will make. The simulator will consist of a LED-based board and a number of light fixtures varying from full-cutoff dark-sky friendly lights to completely unshielded lights. The board, which can be flat or curved depending on space requirements, will simulate the night sky using LED’s of variable brightness, simulating stars of various magnitudes and constellation patterns. The board will be illuminated by the light fixtures and users can use buttons to switch between light fixtures as well as increase or decrease light intensity. This will create a first-hand experience for demonstrating the effect of light pollution as different light fixtures will have different effect on the number of stars visible. The simulator can be used in exhibition halls, conferences, science museums or any other place where light pollution effects can be demonstrated. This physical simulator can provide superior experience for visitors in relation to videos/posters or other usual methods of exhibiting light pollution effects. The purpose is not to create a single simulator but to provide to the public the full instructions including materials needed, dimensions, programming code, electrical wiring etc. so anyone interested can build such a simulator in their local community. Emphasis will be given on using readily available materials that exist in households or that can be purchased at minimal price so everyone can construct at minimal cost.

"The Brazilian Network for Astronomical News",3,2017,"Brazil Portugal  Angola Cape Verde Macau Mozambique Guinea-Bissau Equatorial Guinea Quoted as: ""Intend to reach to all Portuguese-speaking countries through the PLOAD in a possible international collaboration with Mozambique, Angola and Cape Verde, for example."" - Only Brazil was specified","We have established a national network of astronomers interested in public outreach to act as liaison between Brazilian astronomers and the press. The members actively pursue the appearance of national research in the press in order to counter the unbalanced coverage of international astronomy-related news; this in turn will bring greater attention to our science and potentially stimulate more students to pursue an academic career. All material will be made available at the Portuguese Language Expertise Centre for the OAD (PLOAD), in the hopes that the project reach can be extended to other Portuguese-speaking countries."
